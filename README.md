# 🐱 Cat Photo App

This is my very first HTML project, built as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## ✨ About the Project

The Cat Photo App teaches the basics of HTML — including structure, tags, forms, and more — through a simple, adorable cat-themed web page. It was my gateway into coding!

## 🛠️ Skills & Concepts Practiced

- HTML page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Semantic tags like `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`
- Forms, inputs, buttons, and validation
- Accessibility basics (`alt` text, labels)
- Nesting and indentation
- Git & GitHub fundamentals (init, commit, push!)

## 🧪 Live Preview

Coming soon! (I'll deploy this with GitHub Pages next 🔮)

## 📝 What I Learned

Even though I'm just starting out, I already feel more confident understanding how webpages are built. I also created my first GitHub repo and started using version control!
